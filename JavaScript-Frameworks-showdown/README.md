# JavaScript Showdown: Choosing Between Angular, Ember, React, and Backbone.

## Presented

- [Fluent Conf 2014](http://fluentconf.com/fluent2014/public/schedule/detail/31870)

## Layout

There are four folders.

- The `completed-projects` folder contains all four projects with complete code.
- The `empty-projectes` folder contains all the projects with none of the logic but all the HTML, CSS, and the JS libraries ready to go.
- The `presentation-notes` contains all my notes that I use as I go through coding the projects. They are intended to be easy-to-follow so that you could recreate the talk without my speaking.
- The `slides` directory is where the reveal.js presentation lives.

## Development

Please feel free to look over the repos. I'll be developing them bit by bit as I present it multiple times. If you see errors, feel free to fork-and-fix or leave an issue.

## License

This repo contains multiple libraries and images that each have their own license. For what code I've written it's all open sourced under the MIT license.
